# [Laws of Future Landscapes](https://martijndeheer.github.io/Laws-of-Future-Landscapes/)
A data-driven visual storytelling questionnaire by [Rafael Henneberke](www.rafaelhenneberke.com) & [Martijn de Heer](www.martijndeheer.nl)

### Mapping out a collective opinion towards new technologies to use as cartography for maps of the future
This is our goal and our premisse for this project. We want to map out the laws for future landscapes, landscapes being different parts of society (social, educational, etc) and laws being the opinions and relations people have with those topics. 

### Experiments to conduct for initial questionnaire:
- [ ] Make the basic questioning mechanic work
- [ ] Collect the results
- [ ] Display the results at the end
- [ ] Translate results into 3D geometry
- [ ] Add a 'back' button
- [ ] Develop second questionnair with better questions and JSON structure using categories
- [ ] Develop a 'bot' like response to user when using the questionnaire to give a true 'AI' immersive feeling
- [ ] Create a version with binary answering
- [ ] Create a way of easily mapping and creating questions with a clear visual representation, like [this](http://jeremydorn.com/json-editor/)
- [ ] Create a version with instead of textual questions visual questions
- [ ] Research examples of A.I., algorithms and interfaces 

## Topic 1 â€” Artificial Intelligence, Algorithms & Interfaces
Artificial intelligence and algorithms are growing in their presence in our daily lives. With this questionnaire we want to map out till where people feel comfortable to have these technologies influence their lives.

We want to find out to what extend people would accept the dictation of A.I. programs and algorithms.

Both technologies are enhancing digital services to optimize how those services work. By optimizing the results of queries and better problem solving they improve the services but completely change how we interact with our world for better and worse.

The introduction to these technologies goes unseen: it starts with an autocomplete and before you know it we are not involved in writing our own messages.

More importantly as we progress with AI and algorithms these technologies lay down a framework where there is almost no space for the human body, it being the weakest link of the chain. Meaning we would need to protect ourselves against it like we needed to add airbags and seatbelts to our cars for driving too fast than our bodies could handle when crashed.

It seems that the development of both A.I. and algorithms is pushed by interfaces. Creating an urge for simpler, faster and 'better' filtering and navigation of content. If a user just gives his or hers behavior, data and preferences the A.I. and algorithms will do the rest and make sure you will only see 'relevant'  information.

### Categories:
01. Transport
02. Eating
03. Clothing
04. Living
05. Working
06. Entertainment
07. Politics/news
08. Health/sport
09. Free time
10. Finance
11. Perception/Representation

### Concept 01
Presenting a daily journal where the visitors gets to choose where to use A.I. and how much.

### Concept 02
Presenting an index of several categories which ask per category a question, see the categories list for what would be the categories presented.

### Concept 03
Presenting a set of small scenarios or problems to the visitor which has the option to solve it by means of A.I. or without those technologies.

### Concept 04
Ask where people position themselves in relation to A.I., do they expect more responsibility from A.I.? Do people feel stronger than an A.I.? Should an A.I. have more or less privilige than a person?
