# [Laws of Future Landscapes](https://martijndeheer.github.io/Laws-of-Future-Landscapes/)
A data-driven visual storytelling questionnaire by [Rafael Henneberke](www.rafaelhenneberke.com) & [Martijn de Heer](www.martijndeheer.nl)

### Mapping out opinions and feelings towards new technologies
This is our goal and our premisse for this project. We want to map out the laws for future landscapes, landscapes being different topics and parts of society and laws being the opinions and relations people have with those topics. 

### Experiments to conduct for initial questionnaire:
- [ ] Make the basic questioning mechanic work
- [ ] Collect the results
- [ ] Display the results at the end
- [ ] Translate results into 3D geometry
- [ ] Add a 'back' button
- [ ] Develop second questionnair with better questions and JSON structure using categories
- [ ] Develop a 'bot' like response to user when using the questionnaire to give a true 'AI' immersive feeling
- [ ] Create a version with binary answering
- [ ] Create a way of easily mapping and creating questions with a clear visual representation, like [this](http://jeremydorn.com/json-editor/)

## Topic 1 â€” Artificial Intelligence & Algorithms
Artificial intelligence and algorithms are growing in their presence in our daily lives. With this questionnaire we want to map out till where people feel comfortable to have these technologies influence their lives.

Both technologies are enhancing digital services to optimize how those services work. By optimizing the results of queries and better problem solving they improve the services but completely change how we interact with our world for better and worse.

The introduction to these technologies goes unseen: it starts with an autocomplete and before you know it we are not involved in writing our own messages.

More importantly as we progress with AI and algorithms these technologies lay down a framework where there is almost no space for the human body, it being the weakest link of the chain. Meaning we would need to protect ourselves against it like we needed to add airbags and seatbelts to our cars for driving too fast than our bodies could handle when crashed.
