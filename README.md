# [Laws of Future Landscapes](https://martijndeheer.github.io/Laws-of-Future-Landscapes/)
A data-driven visual storytelling questionnaire by [Rafael Henneberke](www.rafaelhenneberke.com) & [Martijn de Heer](www.martijndeheer.nl)

### Mapping out opinions and feelings towards new technologies
This is our goal and our premisse for this project. We want to map out the laws for future landscapes, landscapes being different topics and parts of society and laws being the opinions and relations people have with those topics. 

### Experiments to conduct for initial questionnaire:
- [ ] Make the basic questioning mechanic work
- [ ] Collect the results
- [ ] Display the results at the end
- [ ] Translate results into 3D geometry
- [ ] Add a 'back' button
- [ ] Develop second questionnair with better questions and JSON structure using categories
- [ ] Develop a 'bot' like response to user when using the questionnaire to give a true 'AI' immersive feeling
- [ ] Create a version with binary answering
- [ ] Create a way of easily mapping and creating questions with a clear visual representation, like [this](http://jeremydorn.com/json-editor/)
